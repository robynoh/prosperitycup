The faces of young people are the faces of our past, our present and our future. No segment in the society can match with the power, idealism, enthusiasm and courage of the young people.â€ These words have built a strong conviction amongst the sponsors and organizers of the â€œProsperity Cupâ€ â€“ The Bayelsa Governorâ€™s Football Tournament.<br>The Bayelsa Governorâ€™s Football Tournament aka Prosperity Cup formally called&nbsp;Restoration Cup conceptualized during the tenure of Governor, Henry Seriake Dickson has prominently placed Bayelsa State on the local and international maps. The tournament whose sole aim is uniting the youth, talent search, attracting tourists as well as football scouts and academies to Bayelsa State may be described as an exuberant activity where intense competition becomes natural while obeying the rules of the game.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Aside academic exploit, youth involvement in sports have been seen to foster unity as well as major breakthroughs across the globe. Despite the numerous achievement of the Douye Diri led Government in the sport sector, the Governor is far from relenting in his effort at bringing out the best from the youth through the Prosperity Cup Tournament.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Sen Douye Diri a sportsman, Pan-Ijaw activist, trained teacher and the driving force behind the fourth and fifth editions of the Prosperity Cup is without doubt amongst the few leaders who still believe that encouraging youth involvement in sports is a major factor in national development. His laudable efforts in stimulating youth empowerment to international levels has made positive impact in the lives of the youths and helped in making the Bayelsa youth identify with the goals of the Prosperity Government.&nbsp;<br><br><br>One Important aspect of the Prosperity cup that has equally caught people\'s attention is the continuous contribution of the Deputy Governor, Sen lawrence Ewhrudjakpo and The Bayelsa Commissioner for Sports, Mr Igali in advocating for more private sector involvement in grassroots football development and lucrative rewards and endorsement for excelling footballers to encourage excellence amongst the youth. It\'s no coincidence that both Bayelsa State owned football teams, The Bayelsa United and Bayelsa Queens are winning and doing exploits in the Douye Diri led Prosperity Government.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Similarly Ono Akpe, the Director-General of the Prosperity Cup can also be described as a shining example of&nbsp; a \" passionate man\"&nbsp; who also believes that young people should be at the forefront of global change and empowerment. Prior to the commencement of the fifth edition of the Governorâ€™s Cup Mr Ono Akpe just like Governor Douye Diri declared his resolve to stop at nothing to see young talented players make the best out of their careers.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Previous editions have produced Ewoama FC of Brass Local Government Area (2015), Peretorugbene FC of Ekeremor (2018), Okolobiri FC of Yenagoa (2019), Eternal Grace Ministry (EGM FC) also of Yenagoa (2022) as champions of the first, second, third and fourth editions respectively of the Bayelsa Governorâ€™s Football Tournament. This tournament has seen so many unknown names and faces turn great players. Thus, it is safe to concur with the words of Eduardo Galeano that, \"Good soccer players need not to be titans sculpted by Michelangelo. Your ability is much more important than shape, and in many cases, skill is the art of turning limitations into virtue.â€&nbsp;<br><br><br>We can say with certainty that a lot has been achieved with this competition as several players discovered from this competition now play in different clubs here and abroad. AITEO CUP winner, Okardi Inikurogha, who won the first edition of this tournament with his team, Ewoama FC of Brass where he also emerged as the MVP is now in France.

(46, 'PROSPERITY CUP 2023; OUTSTANDING TALENTS ABOUND IN BAYELSA----Ono Akpe', '\r\nThe Prosperity Cup project\'s director general, Mr. Ono Akpe discusses the benefits and the reasons why the state\'s residents want additional programmes like this in this interview . He discusses how it all started \r\n \r\nIn a build-up to this interview, you said so much about the number of teams, and one of the high points of this yearâ€™s edition is the encouraging news on support? \r\n\r\n \r\nIn the past, we have had wonderful support from SWAN who are members of our LOC. You canâ€™t believe the knowledge they have of the game and the enthusiasm. We have had wonderful and exciting media support from AIT, Arisetv, Channels TV, Brilla FM, and others.\r\nThis year, we are in touch with Sports Giants, Super Sports (DSTV), and the international media group. They are going to cover the final stages of our tournament this year because they have agreed to be our media partner. Talks are in advanced stages, and in the next few days, we are going to conclude on that. We are very desirous that our boys have good careers abroad and locally. We are equally in touch with the NFF and the Sports Ministry to ensure that we are properly guided and given the necessary support. We have also contacted the coaches in Abuja and the main body of the Nigerian referees. \r\nThey will come and monitor the matches and possibly select players for the various national teams. One thing we must note is that there wonâ€™t be any player who has featured in any club side allowed to play here. These are raw talents ready to be brushed for excellence. \r\n\r\nHow did you conceive the idea of this big grassroots tournament?\r\n\r\nThe Bayelsa State Governors Cup also known as Prosperity Cup is a tournament held in support of the Governor, Senator Douye Diriâ€™s efforts to positively engage youths through sports, develop football talents at the community level, stimulate youth empowerment and enhance overall grassroots development thus engendering inter-communal interaction, peace and unity in the state and beyond. Initially known as The Restoration Cup,  it commenced in 2015 during the tenure of former Governor Seriake Dickson with 110 community teams from clubs, religious bodies, and tertiary institutions.\r\n \r\nThis is the sixth year but the 5th edition of the prosperity cup, which is equally the Bayelsa Governors football tournament. We started planning in 2014 but commenced fully in 2015 with the kick-off at the newly built Nembe City SStadiumin Nembe, which our opening match was used to declare that stadium open. This was because the Ultra Modern Samson Siasia Stadium was being remodelled.\r\n \r\nIt was a tournament conceived to positively engage the youths of Bayelsa to become more productive, harness the existing talent which abounds in the state and to equally connect the people, and the communities with the Government in Bayelsa. That was the basic idea we had when we started in 2014. \r\nWe used that period to plan and look at the whole idea before the first edition held in 2015 with the finals in Bayelsa. It was an outstanding success with about 115 teams participating.\r\n \r\nIt was such a huge success that the Police Command in Bayelsa state confirmed that the crime rate in the Metropolis had dropped to its lowest level all through the period the matches were played. This is due to the basic fact that the youths were positively engaged. It gave us a lot of encouragement when we saw that lots of communities were engaged in the tournament.\r\n \r\nThe second edition was held in 2016, and it was equally another exciting tournament that saw 150 teams participating in that tournament. The rise from 115 to 150 showed us that the people were passionate about football and the desire to see them excel. We were also encouraged by the interest shown by all the nooks and crannies of Bayelsa.\r\n \r\nThe exciting thing about the tournament in Bayelsa is that we played across the entire state. In all the eight Local Government Areas, matches were played from the beginning of the tournament till we rounded off the qualifying stages. From the coastal town of Agge to Azzuzuama, Imiringi to Odi, to Nembe and Akasa before the final stages with the last 32 teams coming down to Yenagoa, the state capital, it was a festival of football all through.\r\n \r\nYou have enumerated so much on the exciting part of the Prosperity Cup. How are you mobilizing the funds for the events considering the number of teams involved and the logistics? \r\n \r\nLike I said earlier, the Bayelsa Governors Cup which was initially called the Restoration Cup got so big and so popular when we had 165 teams contesting for honors, and the Minister of Youth and Sports,  Mr.  Sunday Dare, who was our Special Guest of Honour in that yearsâ€™ finals in Yenagoa, called it the largest grassroots football tournament in the country. That excited us. And that equally motivated us to reach out to those whom we need to support us.\r\n \r\nThe support has been tremendous from the Bayelsa State Government led by the sports-loving Governor Douye Diri, who has done so much for youth development in the state.  The governor is ably supported by the hard-working Deputy Governor Senator Lawrence Ewrudjakjpo and his Commissioner of Sports, Olympian Daniel Igali have in a short time taken the sports sector to enviable heights. With a burning desire to transform the youths of the state and indeed the region, a lot has been achieved in this sector.\r\n \r\nGovernor Douye Diri has taken the state from the middle position in Sports to the 2nd position in the last sports festival having come third in the last edition held in Edo state beating larger and other dominating teams like Lagos, Edo, and Kano States. He initiated and started the Unity Games in the state, which is the first local government sports festival in the state. The state became the first and only state to win the AITEO cup for the male and female categories in 2021. Our Mirracle Governor also hosted and sponsored thNationalal Scrabble Championship and wrestling championship, amongst others. He indeed has the touch of a winner.\r\n \r\nWe have had support from Linkage Insurance company, Sterling Bank, and other organizations within the region. We have also got the support of Century Group, the oil service company, Bayelsa Board of Internal Revenue, and the Local Content Management Development Board; they have done well for us. They have supported us twice. But surely they can do better\r\n \r\nVery sadly, we expect more from the oil industry. We have not gotten the support of the IOCs like Shell, AITEO, Agip and others exploiting crude and Gas from Bayelsa even as it is worthy to note that Oloibiri in Bayelsa which has a team is the first place where oil was drilled in Commercial quantity and sold in the international market by Shell. Unfortunately, despite our concerted efforts, they have not been able to do anything for us. The NNPC and the LNG have also not been able to do anything for us. We expect that more organizations and corporate entities will do more for us as their Corporate Social Responsibility. They should know that the youths are involved, and it unites the state more when they engage in meaningful activities to ensure the greater success of the tournament. That is the position for now.\r\n \r\nThe last edition in 2022 attracted many scouts from within, Europe, the Middle le East, Europe, and Australia. What was the magic?\r\n \r\nThe last edition attracted not only international football scouts but also attracted a lot of local scouts as well. It was outstanding. We had scouts from France, the Aspire Academy, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, the Scout from Australia who commented that they came to Nigeria to look for players because their league did not have Nigerians and they felt it was a challenge that any league without Nigerian players is not seen as been outstanding. They needed to get a lot of Nigerian players. They came in and picked up several local players from the tournament. It was a good outing for us and for our young boys. Quite a good number of the players were selected and screened but some had documentation problems. We had about 11 of them expected to travel to Europe to places like Serbia, Asia, and other European countries. More have been snapped up by the local teams in Nigeria, including but not limited to Bayelsa United. In tournament, it is fast turning out to be the true feeder pool for Bayelsa teams. It is important to let you know that in the 2019 edition, the team was taken to Cape Verde, where they played the African Youth Cup. They came third in that tournament. That team was kept together. They came back and won the Bayelsa league cup, the first time an outside team could do so. Outstanding talents that abound in Bayelsa have been exposed through this tournament. The youths are engaged, the coaches are engaged, scouts, and the medical teams, and this is creating a lot of depth in the skills of sportsmen and administrators in Bayelsa. We hope to move with our scouts and the teams in years to come. This tournament engages over 10,000 footballers, administrators, coaches, referees, and other allied supporters for over 3 months the tournament runs. There are a lot of expectations for this yearâ€™s tournament.\r\n \r\nThis year, we want to consolidate the gains of the previous editions. We are excited by the interest shown by the communities. Last year, we had 210 teams. It was astronomical, and you could imagine what it takes to manage that number of teams in a tournament. This year, we had 214 teams, which confirmed it as not only the largest Grassroots Football Tournament in the country but indeed in Africa.\r\n \r\nWe plan to hold a refresher course for the Referees and Match Commissioners in Bayelsa by FIFA-accredited officials. This will improve their knowledge of the rules of the game and strengthen their skills for optimum performance in this beautiful game of football. More so that a FIFA-accredited official is coming to undertake that programme. We have equally proposed a mini-coaching course for our coaches to update them on the laws and rules of the game. We believe in a well-informed society, free and fair officiating, and transparent conduct of all involved. This will improve the skill, management, and handling of players and respect for the officiating officials.\r\n \r\nAgain, we intend to have our international scouts coming in again. We have been flooded with calls from various countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania. At the end of the day, we equally expect that apart from the scouts that come, a select team picked by the scouts will go on a playing tour. We are also in talks with academies in Europe, Asia, and the Eastern bloc. It is important to note that the second batch of scouts came for the last edition. The scouts from KAZ Academy in Europe wanted to pick a lot from the tournament so they could be drilled and moved to teams that needed their service. They wanted players within the range of 15-17 years. In that academy, they go through football and school at the same time. We want more academies to come and take our boys to go through good schools and to foreign clubs thereafter. We want them to have an education and a career in football so they can have something to fall back on when their playing days are over.\r\n \r\nThis year, and very importantly, we want to introduce the female tournament segment. Eight teams will feature in the final stages in Yenagoa. You know that Bayelsa Queens is another high-flying team on the continent. They won the female league as well. The team is Champions of Female Soccer FA Cup and the league. With that, we expect to get new players who will be snapped by the local and foreign scouts and equally put in schools where they will combine football with education.\r\n \r\nWe want to be gender friendly and give the ladies the chance to also exhibit their talents. One of the highlights of this year is that we are going to have the female segment. It may be small, but it will be at the final stages and possibly four or 8 teams if we get the much-needed funds.\r\n \r\nOf course, we have a schedule where and when the foreign scouts will pick the players and equally form solid teams from the entire number registered. We are going to assist the players in excel.\r\n \r\nOne good and interesting thing is that the players are very young. In some cases, we saw boys as young as 13, 14, and 15 from the nooks and crannies of Bayelsa playing. The two boys that were on their way to Serbia when I interviewed them were from the farthest part of Southern Ijaw. These are communities, and to access them will take you close to three or four hours by boat. Luckily, the State Government has continued the massive senatorial road with multiple bridges to Southern Ijaw.\r\n \r\nThese are the talents that abound despite the challenges of navigating to and from their places through rivers and the Atlantic Ocean. We were able to bring them to Yenagoa, and they have not regretted it. It is exciting because the tournament is for boys and girls between the ages of 14 to 21. Since it is a community-based tournament too, we allow about five overage players to be part of it. Though that is not the focus, the focus is on the young and exciting talents from Azzuama to Sagbama, Nembe, and Brass Yenagoa.\r\n \r\nI must acknowledge the support of the former governor of Bayelsa Senator Henry Seriake Dickson who initiated the tournament and supported it for three editions before he completed his second term in office and equally took the players to the African Youth Championship in Cape Verde. I must equally salute the incumbent sports-loving Miracle Governor of the state Senator Douye Diri, who has given us the backing, financially and morally, to ensure that this tournament has grown and is sustained. With his ever-hard-working Deputy Governor Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo and the Olympic Champion, Hon Daniel Igali, they have overseen every activity of this tournament and made sure that things run smoothly. We must thank him for his support, which has made the tournament a resounding success.\r\n \r\nIndeed, we must say that the Prosperity Cup has turned Bayelsa State into a mecca of football for our youths not only in the Nigeria Delta region but across Nigeria as a whole.\r\n \r\nThe 2018/2019 edition with 190 teams attended by the Minister of Sports Hon Sunday Dare who described it as â€œthe largest Grassroots football Tournament in the Countryâ€. A selected team from this edition came 3rd in the African Youth Cup in Cape Verde and also won the 2019 Bayelsa League Cup.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 edition with a total of 210 community-based teams attracted International Scouts from France, South Africa, Australia, and Russia, and about 250 teams are expected to participate in this yearâ€™s edition. Indeed, the tournament has achieved a lot as several players from this competition now play in clubs across Nigeria and abroad.', '18 July 2023', '18', 'July', '2023', 'tt1cgwy87qc845of81zp67bbd96ffb9dc9cbefe0acf608f523b5.jpg', 1),

(51, 'Bayelsa: How we made Prosperity Cup largest grassroots football tournament in Nigeria â€” DG', '<span>The Prosperity Cup Project Director General, Mr. Ono Akpe in this interview with our correspondent bares his minds on the benefits of the annual football fiesta tagged Prosperity Cup and why residents want additional programmes in the state calendar.<br></span><br><b>How do you Garner support for the competition especially in area of sponsorship?<br></b><br><span>In the past, we have had wonderful support from SWAN who are members of our LOC. You canâ€™t believe the knowledge they have of the game and the enthusiasm. We have had wonderful and exciting media support from AIT, Arisetv, Channels TV, Brilla FM, and others.<br><br><br></span><span>This year, we are in touch with Sports Giants, Super Sports (DSTV), and the international media group. They are going to cover the final stages of our tournament this year because they have agreed to be our media partner. Talks are in advanced stages, and in the next few days, we are going to conclude on that. We are very desirous that our boys have good careers abroad and locally. We are equally in touch with the NFF and the Sports Ministry to ensure that we are properly guided and given the necessary support. We have also contacted the coaches in Abuja and the main body of the Nigerian referees.&nbsp;<br></span><br><span>They will come and monitor the matches and possibly select players for the various national teams. One thing we must note is that there wonâ€™t be any player who has featured in any club side allowed to play here. These are raw talents ready to be brushed for excellence.<br></span><br><b>How did you conceive the idea of this big grassroots tournament?<br></b><br><br><span>The Bayelsa State Governors Cup also known as Prosperity Cup is a tournament held in support of the Governor, Senator Douye Diriâ€™s efforts to positively engage youths through sports, develop football talents at the community level, stimulate youth empowerment and enhance overall grassroots development thus engendering inter-communal interaction, peace and unity in the state and beyond. Initially known as The Restoration Cup,&nbsp; it commenced in 2015 during the tenure of former Governor Seriake Dickson with 110 community teams from clubs, religious bodies, and tertiary institutions.<br></span><br><br><span>This is the sixth year but the 5th edition of the prosperity cup, which is equally the Bayelsa Governors football tournament. We started planning in 2014 but commenced fully in 2015 with the kick-off at the newly built Nembe City Stadium in Nembe, which our opening match was used to declare that stadium open. This was because the Ultra Modern Samson Siasia Stadium was being remodelled.<br></span><br><span>It was a tournament conceived to positively engage the youths of Bayelsa to become more productive, harness the existing talent which abounds in the state and to equally connect the people, and the communities with the Government in Bayelsa. That was the basic idea we had when we started in 2014.&nbsp;<br></span><br><br><span>We used that period to plan and look at the whole idea before the first edition held in 2015 with the finals in Bayelsa. It was an outstanding success with about 115 teams participating.<br></span><br><span>It was such a huge success that the Police Command in Bayelsa State confirmed that the crime rate in the Metropolis had dropped to its lowest level all through the period the matches were played. This is due to the basic fact that the youths were positively engaged. It gave us a lot of encouragement when we saw that lots of communities were engaged in the tournament.<br></span><br><br><span>The second edition was held in 2016, and it was equally another exciting tournament that saw 150 teams participating in that tournament. The rise from 115 to 150 showed us that the people were passionate about football and the desire to see them excel. We were also encouraged by the interest shown by all the nooks and crannies of Bayelsa.<br></span><br><br><span>The exciting thing about the tournament in Bayelsa is that we played across the entire state. In all the eight Local Government Areas, matches were played from the beginning of the tournament till we rounded off the qualifying stages. From the coastal town of Agge to Azzuzuama, Imiringi to Odi, to Nembe and Akasa before the final stages with the last 32 teams coming down to Yenagoa, the state capital, it was a festival of football all through.<br></span><br><br><b>You have enumerated so much on the exciting part of the Prosperity Cup. How are you mobilizing funds for the events considering number of teams involved and the logistics?&nbsp;<br></b><br><br><span>Like I said earlier, the Bayelsa Governors Cup which was initially called the Restoration Cup got so big and so popular when we had 165 teams contesting for honorys, and the Minister of Youth and Sports,&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Sunday Dare, who was our Special Guest of Honour in that yearsâ€™ finals in Yenagoa, called it the largest grassroots football tournament in the country. That excited us. And that equally motivated us to reach out to those whom we need to support us.<br></span><br><span>The support has been tremendous from the Bayelsa State Government led by the sports-loving Governor Douye Diri, who has done so much for youth development in the state.&nbsp; The governor is ably supported by the hard-working Deputy Governor Senator Lawrence Ewrudjakjpo and his Commissioner of Sports, Olympian Daniel Igali have in a short time taken the sports sector to enviable heights. With a burning desire to transform the youths of the state and indeed the region, a lot has been achieved in this sector.<br></span><br><span>Governor Douye Diri has taken the state from the middle position in Sports to the 2nd position in the last sports festival having come third in the last edition held in Edo state beating larger and other dominating teams like Lagos, Edo, and Kano States. He initiated and started the Unity Games in the state, which is the first local government sports festival in the state. The state became the first and only state to win the AITEO cup for the male and female categories in 2021. Our Mirracle Governor also hosted and sponsored thNationalal Scrabble Championship and wrestling championship, amongst others. He indeed has the touch of a winner.<br></span><br><br><span>We have had support from Linkage Insurance company, Sterling Bank, and other organizations within the region. We have also got the support of Century Group, the oil service company, Bayelsa Board of Internal Revenue, and the Local Content Management Development Board; they have done well for us. They have supported us twice. But surely they can do better.<br></span><br><br><span>Very sadly, we expect more from the oil industry. We have not gotten the support of the IOCs like Shell, AITEO, Agip and others exploiting crude and Gas from Bayelsa even as it is worthy to note that Oloibiri in Bayelsa which has a team is the first place where oil was drilled in Commercial quantity and sold in the international market by Shell. Unfortunately, despite our concerted efforts, they have not been able to do anything for us. The NNPC and the LNG have also not been able to do anything for us. We expect that more organizations and corporate entities will do more for us as their Corporate Social Responsibility. They should know that the youths are involved, and it unites the state more when they engage in meaningful activities to ensure the greater success of the tournament. That is the position for now.&nbsp;<br></span><br><br><b>The last edition in 2022 attracted many scouts from within, the Middle East, Europe and Australia. What was the magic?<br></b><br><br><span>The last edition attracted not only international football scouts but also attracted a lot of local scouts as well. It was outstanding. We had scouts from France, the Aspire Academy, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, the Scout from Australia who commented that they came to Nigeria to look for players because their league did not have Nigerians and they felt it was a challenge that any league without Nigerian players is not seen as been outstanding. They needed to get a lot of Nigerian players. They came in and picked up several local players from the tournament. It was a good outing for us and for our young boys. Quite a good number of the players were selected and screened but some had documentation problems. We had about 11 of them expected to travel to Europe to places like Serbia, Asia, and other European countries. More have been snapped up by the local teams in Nigeria, including but not limited to Bayelsa United. In tournament, it is fast turning out to be the true feeder pool for Bayelsa teams. It is important to let you know that in the 2019 edition, the team was taken to Cape Verde, where they played the African Youth Cup. They came third in that tournament. That team was kept together. They came back and won the Bayelsa league cup, the first time an outside team could do so. Outstanding talents that abound in Bayelsa have been exposed through this tournament. The youths are engaged, the coaches are engaged, scouts, and the medical teams, and this is creating a lot of depth in the skills of sportsmen and administrators in Bayelsa. We hope to move with our scouts and the teams in years to come. This tournament engages over 10,000 footballers, administrators, coaches, referees, and other allied supporters for over 3 months the tournament runs. There are a lot of expectations for this yearâ€™s tournament.<br></span><br>This year, we want to consolidate the gains of the previous editions. We are excited by the interest shown by the communities. Last year, we had 210 teams. It was astronomical, and you could imagine what it takes to manage that number of teams in a tournament. This year, we had 214 teams, which confirmed it as not only the largest Grassroots Football Tournament in the country but indeed in Africa.&nbsp;<br><span><br>We plan to hold a refresher course for the Referees and Match Commissioners in Bayelsa by FIFA-accredited officials. This will improve their knowledge of the rules of the game and strengthen their skills for optimum performance in this beautiful game of football. More so that a FIFA-accredited official is coming to undertake that programme. We have equally proposed a mini-coaching course for our coaches to update them on the laws and rules of the game. We believe in a well-informed society, free and fair officiating, and transparent conduct of all involved. This will improve the skill, management, and handling of players and respect for the officiating officials.&nbsp;<br></span><br><span>Again, we intend to have our international scouts coming in again. We have been flooded with calls from various countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania. At the end of the day, we equally expect that apart from the scouts that come, a select team picked by the scouts will go on a playing tour. We are also in talks with academies in Europe, Asia, and the Eastern bloc. It is important to note that the second batch of scouts came for the last edition. The scouts from KAZ Academy in Europe wanted to pick a lot from the tournament so they could be drilled and moved to teams that needed their service. They wanted players within the range of 15-17 years. In that academy, they go through football and school at the same time. We want more academies to come and take our boys to go through good schools and to foreign clubs thereafter. We want them to have an education and a career in football so they can have something to fall back on when their playing days are over.&nbsp;<br></span><br><br><span>This year, and very importantly, we want to introduce the female tournament segment. Eight teams will feature in the final stages in Yenagoa. You know that Bayelsa Queens is another high-flying team on the continent. They won the female league as well. The team is Champions of Female Soccer FA Cup and the league. With that, we expect to get new players who will be snapped by the local and foreign scouts and equally put in schools where they will combine football with education.&nbsp;<br></span><br>We want to be gender friendly and give the ladies the chance to also exhibit their talents. One of the highlights of this year is that we are going to have the female segment. It may be small, but it will be at the final stages and possibly four or 8 teams if we get the much-needed funds.&nbsp;<span>Of course, we have a schedule where and when the foreign scouts will pick the players and equally form solid teams from the entire number registered. We are going to assist the players in excel.<br></span><br>One good and interesting thing is that the players are very young. In some cases, we saw boys as young as 13, 14, and 15 from the nooks and crannies of Bayelsa playing. The two boys that were on their way to Serbia when I interviewed them were from the farthest part of Southern Ijaw. These are communities, and to access them will take you close to three or four hours by boat. Luckily, the State Government has continued the massive senatorial road with multiple bridges to Southern Ijaw.&nbsp;<br><span><br>These are the talents that abound despite the challenges of navigating to and from their places through rivers and the Atlantic Ocean. We were able to bring them to Yenagoa, and they have not regretted it. It is exciting because the tournament is for boys and girls between the ages of 14 to 21. Since it is a community-based tournament too, we allow about five overage players to be part of it. Though that is not the focus, the focus is on the young and exciting talents from Azzuama to Sagbama, Nembe, and Brass Yenagoa.&nbsp;<br></span><br><br><span>I must acknowledge the support of the former governor of Bayelsa Senator Henry Seriake Dickson who initiated the tournament and supported it for three editions before he completed his second term in office and equally took the players to the African Youth Championship in Cape Verde. I must equally salute the incumbent sports-loving Miracle Governor of the state Senator Douye Diri, who has given us the backing, financially and morally, to ensure that this tournament has grown and is sustained. With his ever-hard-working Deputy Governor Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo and the Olympic Champion, Hon Daniel Igali, they have overseen every activity of this tournament and made sure that things run smoothly. We must thank him for his support, which has made the tournament a resounding success.&nbsp;<br></span><br><span>Indeed, we must say that the Prosperity Cup has turned Bayelsa State into a mecca of football for our youths not only in the Nigeria Delta region but across Nigeria as a whole.&nbsp;<br></span><br><span>The 2018/2019 edition with 190 teams attended by the Minister of Sports Hon Sunday Dare who described it as â€œthe largest Grassroots football Tournament in the Countryâ€. A selected team from this edition came 3rd in the African Youth Cup in Cape Verde and also won the 2019 Bayelsa League Cup.<br></span><br>The 2022 edition with a total of 210 community-based teams attracted International Scouts from France, South Africa, Australia, and Russia, and about 250 teams are expected to participate in this yearâ€™s edition. Indeed, the tournament has achieved a lot as several players from this competition now play in clubs across Nigeria and abroad.<br>', '14 August 2023', '14', 'August', '2023', 'k6sbqtsygs1ydxrb2f005d75e4c5828105ad563a484ff90d4b12.jpg', 1),

They are all here. Both of the\r\nChristian faith and the Muslim faith you are all welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI welcome you to this review\r\nmeeting. You recall that about two weeks we met in this same hall when the\r\nthreats of COVID-19 were very palpable and ravaging the whole world.\r\nThereafter, we took a lot of precautionary and preventive measures and followed\r\nthem to the letter. We issued a two weeks Preventive order, particularly\r\nclosing down our borders with the neighboring states and our maritime domain.\r\nWe equally took other measures as banning social gatherings, burials, marriages\r\nand various other kinds of social gatherings.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n<span><br>And we set up a committee made up of\r\nall security agencies, health personnel and other members to ensure that our measures\r\nwere strictly complied with. Thereafter, we kept meeting virtually on a daily\r\nbasis to review the level of compliance and the reported cases which we\r\npromptly took to do the testing center and all of them turned out to be negative.\r\nIt will be proper at this stage to mention that I also underwent the test.&nbsp; When it was rumored allover that </span>\r\n\r\nI met with the chief of staff to the\r\npresidents who had tested positive. And everybody felt that I should also submit\r\nmyself to the test and I did that, and now happy to announce to you that mine\r\nwas also negative.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<br><br>And so my comrades in the business\r\nof governance, our duty is to ensure that our people are safe, secured and\r\nhealthy. And to all of us who have been in this committee. I want to say a very\r\nbig thank you to all of you. May we clap for ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<br><br>However, it is not yet uhuru. We are\r\nnot yet there. You are aware that every day all the press, the media houses you\r\ndonâ€™t hear any other thing, there is no other news other than COVID-19 across\r\nthe world, and so the fear is still very palpable. Now that we have come thus\r\nfar and our preventive measures have yielded so much fruits. It is necessary\r\nfor us to call for this meeting to look at the steps we have taken so far, our 14\r\ndays lockdown has expired yesterday.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n<span><br>Do we review, when we review, Do we\r\ngo further to lockdown? Particularly, Knowing fully well with the knowledge that\r\nour sister state Delta have just recorded one COVID-19 case, Rivers has two\r\nCOVID-19 cases. &nbsp;Therefore, the\r\npossibility of getting into Bayelsa is very, very, very, very palpable. It is\r\nfor this regards that we have called for this meeting for us to once again.\r\nLook at the issues and examine them and come up again with necessary\r\nprecautions and measures that will ensure the health of our people, that will\r\nensure that COVID- 19 has no place in Bayelsa State, that all of us who are in\r\nBayelsa, Natives and Nonnatives alike, would stay here healthy without any fear\r\nof COVID-19 getting very close to us. And so I welcome you to this meeting. And\r\nas it is usual, with our meetings, we will take briefings from the health\r\nsector, the information sector and the security sector so that there after we\r\nwill now go into agreeing on the extension of the lockdown, particularly in our\r\nborders and the order precautionary measures that we have so enunciated. So\r\nonce again, thank you all for all your efforts in ensuring that Bayelsa state\r\nis COVID-19 negative. I welcome you to these review meetings. Thank you and God\r\nbless you.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>', '12 May 2020', 1, '8th April, 2020'),

And a very good afternoon to\r\nall of you. First, let me thank God for granting you journey mercies all the\r\nway from Abuja to our dear state Bayelsa, here in Yanagoa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>This groundbreaking ceremony by the oil industry to combat\r\nCOVID-19 with such a gigantic and huge medical infrastructure for the south\r\nsouth region, and located in our state, we can only say thank you. And we\r\nappreciate the Federal Government of Nigeria. Beginning with Mr. President and of\r\ncourse, the man we can jokingly call The deputy president because he\'s the\r\nDeputy Minister of State only to Mr. President, our own son Sylva Timipre. In\r\nthe same vein, I wish to thank and appreciate the Nigerian AGip Oil company,\r\nthe operators of the oil and gas industry and all their cooperators for\r\nagreeing and choosing to locate these very critical facilities in Yenagoa.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>And by so doing, they are also trying to write their name in\r\nthe sands of history, bringing in a difference in the lives of the people of Yenagoa\r\nBayelsa state. The south south And indeed, Nigerians.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>Bayelsa state has been a profitable and hospitable\r\nenvironment, the much we know, for the Nigerian Agip oil company and we aim to\r\nkeep on Deeping these cordial relationships.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>Thomas Kali once said that he who has help, has hope. And he\r\nwho has hope has everything. I\'m especially pleased to be here today as we\r\nbreak the ground for the construction of this structure, because it is in line\r\nwith the covenant we have as a government, with the people of Bayelsa state\r\n\r\nto provide The best health care possible and by extension, fulfill\r\nour commitment to build sustainable prosperity for all people. We further\r\nidentify that this undertaking is not merely about buildings. It is more about\r\nthe people the significance measure and magnitude of this project are self-evident\r\nbut it is more about consolidating and improving the health of our people and\r\nthe health of our communities.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>As we acknowledge us always that all is well, today\'s event is\r\nalso significant for another reason. Not only are we breaking the ground on the\r\nsite physically, but it also restates and demonstrates necessary cooperation on\r\nCSR corporate social responsibility that must exist not only for the oil and\r\ngas industry, but our businesses across the country with the people of the\r\ncovenant.<br>\r\n\r\n<br>It is important to recall the words of the United Nations\r\nSecretary General Antonio Guterres when he presented his report on the socio\r\neconomic impact of COVID-19 shared responsibility, according to him, his global\r\nsolidarity. This is not only a health crisis, but a human crisis, a job crisis,\r\na humanitarian crisis and a development crisis. And it is not just about the\r\nmost vulnerable, this pandemic shows that we are all at risk because we are only\r\nstrong as the weakest health system. <br>\r\n\r\n<br>This unprecedented scale demands an unprecedented response.\r\nWhat we are doing here today is actually an unprecedented response. The\r\nCoronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global predicament of our time\r\nand the greatest challenge we are faced in several generations. Countries are\r\nlocked down; Travel is severely restricted, traditional heavens are\r\ncompromised. If these episodes have thought us any fundamental lesson, it is\r\nthat for those of us in positions of authority, our efforts to effect an effect\r\npositive change must be deliberate and urgent in fulfilling the obligation, it\r\nshould be a timely reminder that we as a government and businesses must be more\r\nconcerned in making the decisions and taking the right steps that create\r\ninclusive and sustainable opportunities for all our citizens\r\n\r\nin Bayelsa state, the Bayelsa state government took proactive\r\nactions, to strengthen surveillance to our boundaries with neighboring states\r\nto prevent the spread of Corona virus into our state, with the diligence of the\r\nstate Task Force on COVID-19, headed by my humble self, and the cooperation of\r\ncitizens who are largely successful in these quests, however, we are now\r\ndealing with a new reality with the confirmation of an index case and for other\r\nmembers of the index case family. So, the timing of this event, when the\r\ndynamics of altered is most welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>It emphasizes the point that we have a shared responsibility\r\nin combating this un scene advisory. But COVID-19 is much more than a health\r\ncrisis. By putting countries it touches under duress. It has the potential to\r\nmake devastating social, economic, and political crisis that will leave serious\r\ndistortions in the fabric of any society. By providing this assistance to keep\r\nthe virus in, check is a commendable one. \r\n\r\nMay I on behalf of the good people of Bayelsa state and the\r\ngovernment of Bayelsa state, and indeed, on behalf of the south south states,\r\nexpress my most sincere gratitude for your obligation, insight and service to\r\nour zone and particularly to our state. Long leave Bayelsa state, Long leave\r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria. Thank you.', '12 May 2020', 1, '20th May, 2020'),
